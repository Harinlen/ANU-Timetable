# ANU Timetable Generator
Due to the rough and bizarre timetable check tools provides by ANU, I wrote this tools for students to generate their own timetable.

This tool supports Windows XP SP2 and above, Mac OS X 10.7 and above, mainstream desktop Linux.

This tool is released via Do What The F**k You Want To Do Public License v2 (WTFv2).
